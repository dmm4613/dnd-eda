# An Analysis of Dungeons and Dragons 5ed Monsters 
## Using data found from [Patrick Gomes at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickgomes/dungeons-and-dragons-5e-monsters/data) I will look to see if I can answer a few questions regarding the diversity of monsters in Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition (to be called 5e for the remainder of this project). I will pose the following questions
### 1. What are the most common monster types (shown as race in this data)?
### 2. Is there a noticeable disparity between monster types?
### 3. What does the spread of alignment look like for an individual monster race?
### 4. Does monster size impact hit point amounts?
### 5. Does a monsterâ€™s armor class have a correlation with its speed or hit points?
